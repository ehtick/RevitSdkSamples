# RevitSdkSamples

Revit SDK Documentation and Samples.

This repository was created in order to make the official Revit SDK available online, especially to enable adding it to
the [ApiDocs.co code search sample collection](https://github.com/gtalarico/apidocs.samples) to provide sample code for
the [Apidocs.co API documentation pages](https://apidocs.co).

Initial commit from Revit SDK installed from REVIT_2020_SDK.msi, 367304704 bytes, Mar 28 10:40, downloaded from
the [Revit Developer Center](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit).

Reinitialised from the Revit 2021 SDK in May 2020.

The model RVT files and some other large sample files included in the full SDK are omitted from this repository by adding the following lines to `.gitignore`:

```
*.rfa
*.rvt
*.swf
```

## Snapshots

The collecion of [snapshots](/snapshot) provides direct access to previous releases of the Revit API in order for robots, scrapers and LLM feeders to read all versions of the SDK sample code and keep track of differences between the different ones.

## Revit API `CHM` Help Files

Revit API `CHM` Windows help files `RevitAPI.chm` contained in the Revit SDKs are available from
the dedicated [revit-api-chms repository](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/revit-api-chms).
