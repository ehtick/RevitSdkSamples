Press *1 for a private pre-recorded help menu. A recorded message will play listing the available touch- tone features.

INSTANT MEETING WEB MODERATOR:

Manage and view your Instant Meeting conference calls over the Internet with our Instant Meeting Web Moderator tool. This online tool allows you to view the number of participants on the call, mute and unmute lines, perform a roll call, lock your call so that no additional parties can enter, send participant lists, and much more. To access this convenient, easy-to-use feature, visit http://www.mymeetings.com/ and choose IM Web Moderator under Leader Tools.

INSTANT MEETING SECURITY:

All passcodes should be carefully protected and kept confidential. We cannot be held responsible for passcode abuse or misuse.
Participants must have the participant passcode to join. Participants will not be able to obtain your passcode information from the conferencing center.
Only one "leader" will be registered on a call (the first person to dial in with the leader passcode) and will be able to perform leader functions. We encourage you not to share your leader passcode with anyone.
The call will terminate 20 minutes after the first participant dialed in if the leader passcode has not been entered and "QUICK START" has been set to OFF. You will be charged usage for the time those participants were on hold.
Your subscription is set up for a maximum number of participants, including you. If more than that number attempt to dial in, they will be blocked, and will hear a message advising them to contact the conference leader. Conference operators cannot increase the capacity of your subscription without advance notice of the call.
For added security to your meeting, the conference leader can pre-screen participants prior to allowing them to enter the main conference.

PARTICIPANT ACCESS INFORMATION:

The text below is the only information you should forward on to call participants. Please ensure that you provide all necessary information to participants in advance of the call.
