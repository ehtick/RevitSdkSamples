Question: is some one there
Answer: yes
Question: Hallo Jeremy, Kannst Du anschliessend an die Präsentation die Präsentation als AVI schicken?
Answer: Hi Ibrahim, This is Saikat - Jeremy might not be able to see this section now but I will pass on your message after the webcast
Question: so will i be able to speak in the mic and talk to him
Answer: The webcast will be in silent mode and so I dont think you will be able to talk while the presentation going on, but if you have questions please use this method to ask your doubts

Question: can I have a record of this meeting?
Answer: yes it will be posted on the ADN website very soon
Question: can you inform me with the directory, when the record of this meeting is posted on the ADN website
Answer: on ADN website if you search with Revit webcast I am sure you will come across this - another way would be to go to Knowledgebase under revit section on ADN and there you shd be able to find the recording
Question: Can we use VS 2008 as well?
Answer: Sorry I have not tested it with VS 2008 as yet, thus I wont be able to answer that
Question: I got disconnected after asking whether Visual Studio 2008 will work instead of 2005.
Answer: Sorry I have not tested it with VS 2008 as yet, thus I wont be able to answer that.
Question: Thanks, do you know if Microsot allows older version installs from VS2008 licenses?
Answer: I am not sure again about this one - some search online might have answer to this in some discussion forums
Question: Will there be a 5-minute break soon? Thank you.
Answer: there is one break for sure but it may be in a while
Question: Okay, thanks.
Answer: :)
Question: why is the graphics on top of the text on the slides?
Answer: thats strange, I can see the text on top of the graphics in the slides...
Question: I believe you can use VS2008, just turn it onto .Net 2.0 mode to ensure compatibility.
Answer: great, thanks for sharing the information. It is good to know
Question: can you ask, at the end of the meeting, the jobs of the attendants? architects, engineers, constructors as a small survey? thanks
Answer: i hve forwarded your req to Jeremy but at this point of time adding new poll might not be possible,. Since this is a good and relevant question, we can include it in future webcasts
Question: Is Revit 2009 SDK available to public without ADN subscription? If so what is the URL? Thanks.
Answer: 2009 SDK is included in the Revit installer under Tools and Utilities section, you can get it from there.
Question: thanks and you made big effort, thanks again!

Answer: thanks
Question: Following the break the phone line I am on has no voice audio. Do you know why the audio has stopped?
Answer: can u use the PC audio (web) for now
Question: In Revit 2008 SDK, we could not see a railing geometry with the ObjectViewer II sample application. I am not sure what we missed but do you know if it is possible to see it in 2009 SDK?
Answer: offhand I would not be able to answer that, can you please check it and if you see it missing, please log it as a case using Dev help online (DHO) on ADN website and we shall look into it
Question: OK I will check and try to report it but I don't have an ADN account...can I email to any of you about it?
Private Answer: I am not sure if I can do that , why dont you give me your email address and I shall get back if I can respond to you directly incase you have any issues
Question: Audio is not coming through the phone only the web
Answer: can you pl try with (USA)866-617-3597 Participant Passcode: 9672646
Question: Is it possible to get some sample code for instantiating the dbapplication object in RevitNet.dll If so, please e-mail resources/links to lmsinger@integrateddbm.com
Private Answer: can you please elaborate on this question
Question: How do you instantiate a new DbApplication object in the RevitNet.dll?
Private Answer: you can access the Application object using commandData.Application (commandData can be accessed from the Iexternalcommand implementation method param)
Question: Refering to ObjectViewer II question, my email is wyan@archmail.tamu.edu . Thanks a lot.
Private Answer: I shall have a look at the sample with railing object and get back to you soon.
Question: We are already using that method. We had some individual meetings with AutoDesk where they suggested using the RevitNet.dll for our purposes. Do we have any samples for this dll, specifically the DbApplication?
Private Answer: I am not aware of this dll to be the part of official API dll. And as far as i know for the same reason the SDK does not contain any samples which use this DLL
Question: Thanks a lot. Another question: using Revit API, can we access texture mapping parameters such as texture image URL and UV coordinates?
Answer: I am not really sure, you can try checking it out using the RvtMgdDbg tool on a given element to see what all parameters are exposed
Question: which is the difference between to get the data from a single revit "schedule" and to get it from the external applications showed here?
Private Answer: Hi Danny: I am not sure I understood the question completely - can you elaborate on what you mean by Single revit schedule
Question: Is it possible to directly access .rvt data using API without running Revit?
Private Answer: unfortunately out of proc access is not possible nor supported at the moment
Question: Conference calling center is still not working
Answer: can you please try using the PC audio for now
Question: what advantages does the ADN have over just using the SDK with free utilities. What benefits do you get (I need to justifty it to my boss...)
Private Answer: can you pl have a look at this link: http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=723353
Question: Why use VSTA not API?
Private Answer: VSTA also uses the API but there are many advantages of using VSTA - its is good for a quick testing of your code and that you do not need to register the macros in Revit.ini, or add RevitAPI.dll as a reference.
Question: The pc audio keeps dropping...did I hear correctly that macros cannot be shared among users unless embedded as document type?
Private Answer: Anyone who opens the .rvt can run the macros, provided the person using the macro and the person who built the macro have both installed VSTA for their respective Revit products.
Question: so it the VSTA is for testing, but the final is better use API?
Private Answer: as i said both use the API, you can embed macros in rvt files and share the rvt files with other users and they can run ur macros to do some specific functionality...so its not just for testing. if you have used VBA before for other autodesk products, this is pretty much the same as that. Pl have a look a the SDK files which contain some DOCS on this
Question: Is there an external file format for macros for sharing with other projects, offices, etc.? Or can the macros be imported from other RVT files?
Private Answer: Applicationlevel macros are available to all opened Revit projects in the current instance of the Revit application and Documentlevel macros are embedded in the currently open projects .rvt file. Anyone who opens the .rvt can run the macros, provided the person using the macro and the person who built the macro have both installed VSTA for their respective Revit products. On disk, Applicationlevel macro projects are stored in a subfolder of the Revit installation directory. For example: C:\Program Files\Revit Architecture 2009\Program\VstaMacros\AppAddIns\defaultAddIns\...Documentlevel macro projects are stored within an .rvt file. On disk, when the associated .rvt project opens, any built and saved macro(s) are stored temporarily in: C:\Program Files\Revit Architecture 2009\Program\VstaMacros\DocAddIns\defaultAddIns\... However, these Documentlevel macro files are deleted from your local computer when their corresponding Revit project document (.rvt) closes. The saved Documentlevel macros are stored in the .rvt file.
Question: So to share Application level macros, we would have to script copies out to users local hard drives? Would the application have to be restarted to see new app level macros which have been copied to the local folder?
Private Answer: I would think so, but honestly I have not tried it out yet.
Question: Thanks
Answer: np :
Question: Sorry this question is probably too specific. Just if you happen to know it: is there a way to access the information of which two rooms (room numbers) that a door is connecting using API? Thanks.
Answer: it is possible. Please check out the Revit API User manual (page 256 onwards) . This doc is available on ADN
Question: Thanks,
Answer: welcome
Question: Can I animate my view using API?
Answer: sorry that is not possible presently
Question: where can I download the record of this meeting? please inform me the web address
Answer: it will be made available on ADN website, please do a search on revit webcast in couple of days
Question: what is the address for the ADN wedsite?
Private Answer: adn.autodesk.com
Question: Can mental ray material appearances be created through the API?
Answer: Not at the moment
Question: Can we have the recorded video without ADN account? That will be really helpful.
Answer: can u mail to your training coordinatore
Question: if I am not a ADN Member, can I still have a record of this meeting?
Answer: can you please email the person who invited you to this session, he might be able to help you with this
