in-conference features:
  All participants must use a touch-tone phone to participate in an Instant Meeting conference. The following features are available for you to use during an active conference: 
  *1 for a private pre-recorded help menu. A recorded message will play listing the available touch- tone features. 
  *2 for a roll call (conference). A playback of the participants' names who have joined the call will be played into the conference. This feature is only available when Name Record feature is set to "yes." 
  *3 for a roll call (private). A playback of the participants' names who have joined the call will be announced to the initiator only. This feature is only available when Name Record feature is set to "yes." 
  *4 to mute or unmute the entire conference (except for your line). 
  *5 to enable Conference Continuation. This allows you to determine if the active conference can continue after you disconnect. In order to use this feature, Auto Continuation must be set to "yes." 
  *6 to mute or unmute your line. 
  *7 to lock or unlock the conference. If you lock the call, those attempting to join will hear a prompt indicating the conference has been "secured." 
  *8 to dial out to additional participants within North America. 
  *9 for Entry/Exit options. You can specify how the entry and exit of participants are announced for the active conference: by tone, by recorded name, or by silent entry.

Webcast synopses:

The Revit family API provides access to programming facilities within the family editor context and can be used to automate Revit content creation based on existing part databases and other library specifications, create and modify family content, extract family definitions from existing projects, define references, constraints, formulas, annotation and dimensioning, and visibility control. We also demonstrate the Revit SDK family API samples.

The Revit MEP API provides access to analyze and modify Revit MEP models in all domains including HVAC, electrical and plumbing. The webcast  discusses how to analyse and create MEP systems and elements including ducts, pipes, fittings, and connectors, traverse systems, use new part creation methods to implement automatic splitting of parts, obstruction avoidance, routing automation, and demonstrates the Revit MEP SDK samples.
