
Hi Mikako,

RST link was migrated to Revit 2011. In this version, there is almost no additional functionality.

I slightly changed the implement code in these aspects.

1.	Element Iteration. 
2.	GetFamilySymbol() method

There is no code change to other 5 projects that based on AutoCAD, except for referencing to the new reference in 2011.

Miro,
RstLinkAutoCADClientCs
RstLinkAutoCADClientVb
RstLinkCs
RstLinkVb

I tested both workflow, Revit->AutoCAD and AutoCAD->Revit.  

In the next step, I plan to add functionality to add the code to create the new member created in AutoCAD when importing the model.

Any suggestion is appreciated. 

Thanks,

Joe
