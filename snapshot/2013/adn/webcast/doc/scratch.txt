Control of the Idling event repetition
Idling event with no active document
New external events framework
RevitWebcam revisited
Use of OpenAndActivateDocument in event handlers 

default mode: raise one event per idle session
non-default mode: keeps idling session open and make repeated calls
SetRaiseWithoutDelay

Interface IExternalEventHandler
Implement Execute and GetName methods
Static ExternalEvent.Create method with event handler instance returns event
Event.Raise signals something to do

ExternalEvent exEvent = ExternalEvent.Create(handler);

DevDays Online recording demonstrates the actions of the UIAPI SDK samples for the contextual help F1, WPF preview control, drag and drop, customize options dialogue last four options including IFC command override and switching button availability based on discipline
is also demos the schedule sample
MEP routing preferences
stairs and railings
all without looking at any code
here we will examine the code as well.

point out that the DoDragDrop cannot be called asyncronously, nor you need a valid Revit API context.

Dominique Gladeau: hi i missed the first part of the class?
Dominique Gladeau: can you help me retake it from the start?
Jeremy Tammik: oh dear. well the recording will become available in a few days
Jeremy Tammik: just look at the recording.
Dominique Gladeau: not sure how. in a few days or can i do it now?
Jeremy Tammik: ?
Dominique Gladeau: does the first part of the class show how to build and load code?
Dominique Gladeau: I really need the class please email me the link for me to review.
Dominique Gladeau: thanks my email is gladeau@live.ca
Jeremy Tammik: no not really. look at the revit developer center for that, it tells you all: http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit
Dominique Gladeau: can the api allow me to make text the same height in my drawings?
Dominique Gladeau: what is the difference between api and sdk?
Dominique Gladeau: got it thanks
Dominique Gladeau: can I code in c# or C++ or both?
Jeremy Tammik: look at the material on the develoepr center
Jeremy Tammik: http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit
Dominique Gladeau: bye thanks!
Dominique Gladeau leaves.
